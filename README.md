AshEdit is a tile-based level editor used for Crystal Picnic and Monster RPG 2.

See the built-in help for keyboard shortcuts.

Tiles are loaded from directories -- each tile set can have multiple sheets (all the same size) named tiles0.png, tiles1.png and so on (or .tga if you ask CMake to build that way.)
